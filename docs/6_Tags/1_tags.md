- **Folder**: These are for organizing your Collections in to logical groups 
- **Collection**: A Collection can contain multiple Tags. Collections are used to group Tags together, And to create filters.
- **Tag**: This will create a new Tag. Every Tag has to belong to a Collection 

By default, you can assign any tag to any resource, but you can also restrict a Collection to one or more resource types.
