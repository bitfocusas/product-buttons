**Cuelist**

![Cuelist](images/cuelist_1.png)
In the cuelist you can build all cues (lighting looks, camera shots, video clips, audio triggers, etc.) in a list format much like a spreadsheet or newsroom rundown. Each row represents a cue, and each cue can execute a number of actions either all together or timed. It can also control the advancement of the cuelist itself. 

![Cue1](images/cuelist_cue_1.png)

Each cue can have a name and a color, and you can stack as many actions as you like in each cue.

![Cue2](images/cuelist_cue_2.png)

You can also use conditional logic to control the flow of the cues, where a Condition will be tested for a true or false value determining which actions will be executed. 

![Add Cue](images/add_cue.png)

You can add cues and sub-cues after the currently selected cue by clicking the **+ Add Cue** button.

![Sub Cue](images/sub_cues.png)

You can also make a cue, a sub-cue of another cue. By dragging and dropping it on top of the cue you want to make it a sub-cue of.

![Reorder](images/reorder_cues.png)

To reorder cues drag and drop it between the cues where you want to insert the cue. The cuelist will auto renumber on any changes to the order.

> **TIP!** There are Internal Actions to navigate the cuelist.
