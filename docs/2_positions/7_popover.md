**Popover sections** are special **Sections** that expand out from a single button. These are ideal for functions that you want easily accessible but don't use frequently.

### Steps to Create a Popover

1. **Select Starting Cell**  
   Click on the cell where you want to place your Popover.

4. **Popover Creation**  
   The selected cells will now be converted into a Popover. Even though you selected 32 cells, only the starting cell is initially occupied, leaving the remaining 31 cells free for other sections and buttons.
