The **Shift Section** effectively doubles the "real estate" available by adding an additional layer of cells, accessible with the press of a single button.





1. **Select the Starting Cell**  
   Click on the cell where you want the shift section to begin.

### Benefits of a Shift Section

With the Shift Section in place, you now have a button to toggle between the main and shift layers. This is particularly useful for setups like PTZ camera presets, where:

- **Save Functions** can be assigned to the Shift layer.
- **Recall Functions** can remain on the Main layer.

Additionally, if you make the section scrollable, you can fit even more buttons within the same cells on the canvas.
