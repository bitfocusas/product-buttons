### Managing Folder Sections in the Inspector

- Navigate to the **Inspector** and open the *Navigation* dialog.  
  You will see the **Main** and the different sub-folders listed. To add additional subfolders, click the **+ Add Folder** button in the bottom of the *Pages* dialog. You can drag and drop any folder on top of another folder to make it a subfolder of that folder.

- As you add pages or subfolders, a familiar hierarchy forms in the *Pages* dialog. You can:  
  - Rename folders.  
  - Change colors and icons.  
  - Modify the folder layout order (e.g., left-to-right or top-to-bottom).  
  - Adjust the return button within each folder.
  - Turn off the Folder navigation buttons
  - Turn off the return Button. 

- Additionally, you can utilize the *Scroll* function within subfolders to fit more buttons into the same cell area.  
> **TIP** You can use the internal action *Set Active Page* to create your own navigation
