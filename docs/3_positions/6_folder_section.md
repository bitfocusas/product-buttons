**Folder sections** function similarly to **Shift sections**, but with the added flexibility of multiple layers. You can navigate a folder section using the familiar method of folders and subfolders.


### Steps to Create a Folder Section

1. **Select Starting Cell**  
   Click on the cell where you want to start your folder section.

### Managing Folder Sections in the Inspector

- Navigate to the **Inspector** and open the `Pages/Scroll` dialog.  
  You will see the **Home** folder listed. To add subfolders, click the `+` button in the bottom-left corner of the `Pages` dialog.

- As you add pages or subfolders, a familiar hierarchy forms in the `Pages` dialog. You can:  
  - Rename folders.  
  - Change colors and icons.  
  - Modify the folder layout order (e.g., left-to-right or top-to-bottom).  
  - Adjust the return button within each folder.  

- Additionally, you can utilize the `Scroll`/`Overflow` function within subfolders to fit more buttons into the same cell area.
