Position is how we define a collection of one or multiple surfaces, It also typically aligns with the working position of a person for example Vision Mixer, Graphics or Shader. Each position may be Tag'ed for better Organization. You can create a new position by pressing the (+create) in the top of the left pane
You will then be presented with a dialog box to enter a label for the position. Some planing regarding naming conventions is smart so that the system will be logical and consistent.

The position editor window has 3 panes the left which is the Navigation tree, the middle which is a 16x16 button grid by default and the right which contains Inspector, Presets and Configuration tabs.
