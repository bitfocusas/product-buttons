![Position](images/position/positions.png 'Position')

**Position** defines a collection of one or more **Surfaces**. It typically aligns with the working role of an individual, such as Vision Mixer, Graphics, or Shader. Each **Position** can be tagged for better **Organization**. To create a new **Position**, click the `+Create` button at the top of the left pane. 

A dialog box will appear, prompting you to enter a label for the **Position**. It's a good idea to plan your naming conventions beforehand to maintain a logical and consistent system. You can also create **Positions** when configuring your **Surfaces**.

**Click** *Create Position*, and the **Position Editor** window will open.

![Position editor window](images/position/position_editor_window.png 'Position Editor Window')

The **Position Editor** window consists of three panes:
- **Left Pane**: Navigation tree  
- **Middle Pane**: A 16x16 grid called the **Canvas**  
- **Right Pane**: Contains **Inspector**, **Presets**, and **Configuration** tabs  

![Inspector](images/position/inspector.png 'Inspector')

In the **Inspector**, you'll see the default grid size of 16W x 16H. Leave it as is for now, as it can be modified later. Start by navigating to the **Configuration** tab.

Here, you can change the name, add a description for the **Position**, and assign **Surfaces** to it.

![Configuration_2](images/position/configuration_2.png 'Configuration_2')

**Click** *Assign Surface* and select the desired **Surface**.

![Configuration 3](images/position/configuration_3.png 'Configuration 3')

The selected **Surface** will appear in the **Canvas** in the **Configuration** tab. A corresponding outline will also display in the center pane **Canvas**, showing the part of the **Canvas** covered by the **Surface**. You can move the **Surface** to your preferred position on the **Canvas** by dragging it. Letâ€™s quickly add another **Surface**.

Now, there are two **Surfaces** assigned to the **Position**. The outlines correspond to the button layouts of the assigned **Surfaces**:  
- The **STREAM DECK STUDIO** has two rows of 16 buttons.  
- The **STREAM DECK XL** has four rows of 8 buttons.  

You can combine **Surfaces** freely within the same **Canvas**, moving them around in the **Configuration** window. Overlapping parts of **Surfaces** will display shared buttons.

![Click inside any rectangle](images/position/click_inside_any_rectangle.png 'Click inside any rectangle')

**Click** inside any rectangle; its outline will become dashed, indicating it's selected. **Right-click** to open the context menu. From here, you can create a **Button**, **Section**, **Shift Section**, **Folder Section**, **Popover**, or **Router**. The **Paste** and **Clear Selection** options are self-explanatory, but the other features will be explained further.

![Right Click](images/position/right_click.png 'Right Click')

**Click** on **Button**.

![Click on Button](images/position/button_on_grid.png 'Click on Button')

You have now created a **Button**.

![Side pane](images/position/side-pane_callout.png 'Side Pane')

To optimize your workspace, you can move the **Inspector** pane from the side pane to the bottom of the screen. This setting provides more real estate for making multiple edits without excessive navigation.
