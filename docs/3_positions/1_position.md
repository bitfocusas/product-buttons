**Position** is how we define a collection of one or multiple **Surfaces**, It also typically aligns with the working position of a person for example Vision Mixer, Graphics or Shader. Each **Position** may be Tag'ed for better **Organization**. You can create a new **Position** by pressing the *(+create)* in the top of the left pane.
You will then be presented with a dialog box to enter a label for the **Position**. Some planing regarding naming conventions is smart, so that the system will be logical and consistent.

**Click** *Create position*, and the **Position** editor window will open.

![Position editor window](images/position/position_editor_window.png 'position editor window')

The **Position** editor window has 3 panes the left which is the Navigation tree, the middle which is a 16x16 grid called **Canvas** and the right which contains **Inspector**, **Presets** and **Configuration** tabs.

![Inspector](images/position/inspector.png 'inspector')

The **Inspector** will show the grid size of 16W and 16H let's leave it at that for now, but it can be changed at any time.
Let's first go to the configuration tab

![Configuration](images/position/configuration_1.png 'Configuration')

Here we can change the name, give a description of the **Position** and assign **Surfaces** to the **Position**.

![Configuration_2](images/position/configuration_2.png 'Configuration_2')

**Click** on *Assign Surface* and select the appropriate **Surface**.

![Configuration 3](images/position/configuration_3.png 'Configuration 3')
You will notice that the **Surface** appears in the **Canvas** above in the configuration tab and a similar outline appears in the center pane **Canvas**, this shows you which part of the **Canvas** the **Surface** will cover. You can grab the **Surface** in the configuration tab to move it in to the position you want on the **Canvas**, Let's quickly add another **Surface**.

![Configuration 4](images/position/configuration_4.png 'Configuration 4')

As you see there is now 2 **Surfaces** assigned to the **Position** and at the moment they overlap, you will also notice that the outline matches the number of buttons of the assigned **Surface** STREAM DECK STUDIO has 2 rows of 16 buttons and the STREAM DECK XL has 4 rows of 8 buttons. Any combination of **Surfaces** are allowed the same canvas. Any **Buttons** on overlapping parts of surfaces will appear on both

![Click inside any rectangle](images/position/click_inside_any_rectangle.png 'Click inside any rectangle')

**Click** inside any rectangle, the outline will be dashed to show that it's selected. Now you can ***Right click*** to bring up the context menu from here you can create a **Button**, **Section**, **Shift Section**, **Popover** and **Plugins** **Paste** and **Clear Selection** are self-explanatory, but we will go through the rest.

![Right Click](images/position/right_click.png 'Right Click')
