With Tag based routing you can ensure.

- Efficient Resource Usage: Only relevant recipients receive the content, reducing unnecessary bandwidth consumption and processing overhead.

- Personalized Experience: Tag-based routing enables highly targeted broadcasts, improving the end-user experience by delivering relevant content.

- Scalability: In large-scale systems with hundreds or thousands of users or devices, tag-based routing simplifies managing broadcast distribution, allowing for fine-grained control without manually configuring recipients.

Tag-based routing in broadcasting leverages metadata to direct broadcasts intelligently and selectively. It enhances efficiency by ensuring that only relevant audiences or devices receive the message, whether it's for media, advertising, emergency alerts.
