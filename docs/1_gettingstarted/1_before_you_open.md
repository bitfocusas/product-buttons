## Starting buttons

![alt text](images/watchdog.png)

When you start **Buttons**, a window pops up displaying all the running processes. From this window, you can restart any processes that aren’t running. You can also open the web interface here, and it’s the right place to quit **Buttons** if needed.

Under the settings cogwheel you will find some environment settings.

The **Editor Listen Address** will let you limit on which network the Buttons management UI will be available.

You can also change which port the management UI will use for both HTTP and HTTPS.
